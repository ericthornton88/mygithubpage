		<h1>Why MX?</h1>
		<p>In early 2013, I just finished my first season playing BYU football. As a walk-on, I lettered in my first season on the team and things were looking really bright. Coding came into my life and it was an instant hook.</p>
		<p>I now had a decision to make. Spend my time playing football, or learn to code. I chose the latter. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, but I haven’t regretted it since. Since finishing college with a CS degree wasn’t an option for me, I looked elsewhere. I chose to take a semester off college, move to Arizona, and do a 12-week programming bootcamp.</p>
		<p>Since finishing the bootcamp in April, I've been working for a small start-up doing PHP and some basic front-end.</p>
		<p><strong>So why switch to an apprenticeship program when I’m already working as a developer?</strong></p>
		<p>From talking with friends at MX, here are things I repeatedly hear:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The engineers are really smart</li>
			<li>Code quality (not quantity) is king</li>
			<li>The culture is top-notch</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I like where I’m working right now, but I want to be where I can be the best engineer I can be. I believe sacrifice is the way that we really show what we want. My pay is currently above $50k per year, and I’ve got a wife, son, and a child on the way. Financial stability is huge for me right now. I’m willing to sacrifice that stability and comfort for an opportunity to learn from the best at MX.</p>
