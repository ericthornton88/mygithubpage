		<h1>Why MX?</h1>
		<p>Simply put, I want to be an awesome software engineer.</p>
		<p>What peaked my initial interest in MX was many conversations with the infamous Dan Jones. In my talks with him, I never heard a single complaint, or negative word about MX. What I came to find was that anyone associated with MX was on the same page. Always positive, yet realistic feedback. I heard three things over and over again:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>MX works hard.</li>
			<li>MX hires genius people.</li>
			<li>MX produces VERY clean code.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These are the main things that have drawn me to MX.</p>
		<p>A friend first introduced me to code about a year and a half ago and I was into it immediately. At the time I just finished my first season playing BYU football as a walk-on. I lettered in my first season on the team and things were looking really bright, but I had a decision to make. Spend my time playing college football or become a software engineer. I chose the latter. It's been one of the best decisions I've ever made. Right now I'm in my first job making a comfortable $50,000+ per year.</p>
		<p>I say all this to give you a little personal background to what has brought me to this point. A lot of people say that they want to be with a company that has awesome culture and growth. A lot of people say it, but I gave up football to become a software engineer and I'm taking more than $20,000 in pay cut to come to MX. To be clear, I'm all about the culture and growth at MX.</p>
