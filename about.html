		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>I grew up in Idaho. Sports and new technology were the things I loved.<br>After I finished playing collegiate sports, I realized that web development is what I wanted to pursue.</p>
		<h1>Web Dev</h1>
		<p>I always thought programming was for nerds. Maybe it is but I guess that makes me a nerd.<br> A friend introduced me to code and I was surprised by how much I liked it.<br> After a couple programming courses, I realized I wanted to make a career out of programming.<br> The best option was attending a development bootcamp. </p>
		<h1>Bootcamp</h1>
		<p>The bootcamp consisted of a 9-5 schedule Mon-Fri. Those were the base hours that were rarely followed.<br> All-in-all I spent about 600 hours in code during the bootcamp.<br> After all that time I wish I could claim zen master status, but I can't.<br> I've got a lot to learn and improve on, but I've got the desire and work ethic to make it happen.</p>
		<h1>Now</h1>
		<p class="preLi">Here the areas that I've put in the most time:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Laravel</li>
			<li>Javascript</li>
			<li>HTML</li>
			<li>CSS/Sass</li>
			<li>MySql</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>Command Line</li>
			<li>Github</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="preLi">Other technologies that I have a working understanding of are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>AJAX/JSON</li>
			<li>Gulp</li>
			<li>Bower</li>
			<li>Handlebars</li>
			<li>C++</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Web development is ever changing, so I've put forth a lot of effort to understand concepts so I can be versatile and a better asset to whoever I'm around.</p>
		<h1>More than code</h1>
		<p class="preLi">Here are things I can deliver on outside of code:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Hard work</span>-I'm a former walk-on. I approach my work with the same attitude.</li>
			<li><span>Socks</span>-I'm particular with my socks. You can count on me to be in unique socks.</li>
			<li><span>Posi Vibes</span>-Positve Vibes benefit all those around them. I'm all about Posi Vibes.</li>
		</ul>
